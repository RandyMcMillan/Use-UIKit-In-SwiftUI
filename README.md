A sample project for my blog post post [Use UIKit components in SwiftUI: UIViewControllerRepresentable and UIViewRepresentable](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2020/07/02/expose-uikit-to-swiftui/), where I show 
how you can use UIKit based components inside a SwiftUI project. 

### Description

This is a quote from the post:

> ... But as a consequence of the fact that UIKit has been with us [for almost twelve years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK) and there are millions of apps already publish on the app store, a lot of developers have tons of UKit based library and custom components. Another interesting point is the fact that at the moment of this writing a lot of UIKit components from the iOS SDK  are [missing a counterpart in SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/answering-the-big-question-should-you-learn-swiftui-uikit-or-both "uikit missing swiftui").  
Anyway, you are just starting to develop a new app and you want to create it in SwiftUI (targeting only for iOS 13 because, you know, SwiftUI is compatible only with it :laughing:) without losing the ability to speed up you development by reusing your UIKit based libraries and components. Is there a solution to this problem? Yes!! :relaxed:
In this post I will show you how you can leverage the power of `UIViewRepresentable` and `UIViewControllerRepresentable` protocols to expose your UIKit views and controller as standard SwiftUI components...
